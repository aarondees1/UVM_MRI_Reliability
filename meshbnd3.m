function out = meshbnd3(tri)
%MESHBND3 Finds and orders a list of boundary nodes so the nodes form a
%         closed connected boundary around the outside edges of a
%         triangular mesh.  See MESHBND2.M for a similar method using
%         the boundary nodes if they are known.
%
%         OUT = MESHBND3(TRI) given a three (3) column triangle
%         connectivity matrix, TRI, returns an ordered list of boundary
%         nodes, OUT, that forms a closed connected boundary of the
%         outside edges of the triangular mesh.
%
%         NOTES:  1.  The node list starts and ends with the lowest
%                 node ID.
%
%                 2.  The ordering can be either clockwise or counter-
%                 clockwise.
%
%                 3.  The node list will connect any holes in the mesh
%                 to other holes and the outside boundary.  Best for
%                 continuous surfaces without holes.
%
%                 4.  See MESHBND2.M for a similar method using the
%                 boundary nodes if they are known.  This is useful for
%                 limiting the outside to just the input boundary nodes
%                 (e.g. around a hole in the surface or just the
%                 exterior edges of a surface that includes a hole).

%                 or directory.
